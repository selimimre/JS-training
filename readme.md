This is 4th channge of Code Academy JS Challanges.
Write a function, lifePhase(), that takes in a person’s age, as a number, and returns which phase of life they are in.

Here are the classifications:
0-3 should return 'baby'
4-12 should return 'child'
13-19 should return 'teen'
20-64 should return 'adult'
65-140 should return 'senior citizen'
If the number is less than 0 or greater than 140, the program should return 'This is not a valid age'
